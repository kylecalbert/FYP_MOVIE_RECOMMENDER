# FYP_MOVIE_RECOMMENDER

This was a final year project. It is a simple project which Conceptulizes the idea of recommending movies to users based on their context. The project allows users to rate movies, but the users will have to input whether they were alone, with friends or with family when they watched the movie
The project also logs the time the user rates the movie. These allow the system to track the types of movie the user likes given the context; The project is based on the presumption the user has rated the movie as soon as they have finished it. It uses mahcine learning algorithms including collaborative filtering to predict the movies a user likes.
